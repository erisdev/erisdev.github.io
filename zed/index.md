Zed Shaw sent this nastygram to me and [eevee](https://github.com/eevee) in response to some tweets we made expressing our dislike for [Learn Python the Hard Way's ugly, inaccessible web site](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). I've already commented on it elsewhere, so I'll let the e-mail speak for itself here.
