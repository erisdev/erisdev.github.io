I make computers do things. Once I've nailed down the design a little better, this will be a showcase of the things I make them do.

Web design is perhaps not my _strongest_ skill, but it's fun--especially when it works!

I'm rather fond of Ruby!

You can also Find me elsewhere on the net, where things are more interesting.
