you're standing in my workshop. and by workshop i mean a derelict interplanetary transport that's been roughly divided into living & working areas. the space is claustrophilic. packed, but not cramped.

there's a [big critter][eris] standing by the airlock.. hey, that's me!

the walls are covered floor to ceiling with [drawings][], blueprints and [a bigass tool rack][tool rack].

square in the middle is my [workbench][]. this is where the good shit happens.

underneath is the [junk drawer][] where scrapped or outdated projects are kept. stuff that i'm not interested in any more, but that i can't bring myself to throw out.

tucked away in the corner is [my terminal][]. you can use that to see what i've been up to lately.

and at the far end is ~~what's left of~~ the [cockpit][].
