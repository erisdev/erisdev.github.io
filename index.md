Call me Eris, or Riz. I make computers do things. Once I've nailed down the design a little better, this will be a showcase of the things I make them do. Sometimes those things are cute, sometimes unseemly, occasionally fun or even useful.

Web design is perhaps not my _strongest_ skill, but it's fun--especially when it works!

I enjoy Minecraft, both creative and survival. Redstone is one of my favorite aspects of the game and I'm always excited when the developers add a new Redstone-compatible block.

I'm rather fond of Ruby!

You can also find me elsewhere on the net, where things are more interesting.
