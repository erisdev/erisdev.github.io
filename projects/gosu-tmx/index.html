		<h3>introduction</h3>
		<p><strong>gosu-tmx</strong> is, as the name implies, a TMX map loader for
			Gosu. Most importantly, it supports an arbitrary number of layers and
			provides hooks for object group creation so it can be integrated with
			other libraries built on top of Gosu. Don't believe me? Have a look at
			this:

		<p>Now that I've got your attention, why not help out? There's always room
			for improvement, and I don't consider the library anywhere near
			complete. Comments and suggestions are welcome and encouraged.
