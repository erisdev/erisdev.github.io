# README

It's me, except a web site. Pretty neat, huh? Feel free to use, abuse, misuse, mix, match, borrow or steal any code, markup or CSS you find here.

Everything is made by me except for the following:

    css/gist.css
    js/ext/*
    themes/*

## Gist Colors

These colors were shamelessly ripped from Mark Dodwell's Cool [Glow TextMate theme][COOL].

Have a look at the original, of courseâ€”it looks much better than this.
