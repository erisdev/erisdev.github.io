# fight fucking bullshit on twitter
If there's one thing twitter loves, it's Engaging your Favorite Brandsâ„¢. twitter is "committed to providing a safe environment for brands to build their business".

well, fuck brands. brands suck. brands can go to hell.

I run this one for now, but eevee has access. may be automated in the future.

[Let me know](http://twitter.com/erisdev) if you have a list that you think belongs here.

## more shit
I'm thinking about turning the mass-block script I used to get `flareon_brands` started into a heroku app. we'll see.
