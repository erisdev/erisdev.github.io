            <h1>LETTER_FROM_ZED</h1>

            <p>zed "rails is a ghetto" shaw sent this nastygram to me &amp;
                eevee in response to some tweets we made expressing distaste
                for <cite>learn python the hard way</cite>'s inaccessible
                website. i'll let the letter speak for itself. it's pretty
                hilarious</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Hey super cool awesome people. I saw you didn't like the
                    design I had made for me because it doesn't work on your
                    fancy hipster phones.  Really sorry about that, and I'll
                    start working on it as soon as I'm done working on my next
                    book that millions of people will read.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, I took the liberty of going through your
                    shitty fucking websites and doing some on-screen critiques
                    of them.  I think you'll find my advice is very helpful
                    should you ever want to pull your heads out of your asses
                    and actually practice what you preach.</p>

                <p> Have an awesome day being total fucking assholes,<br>
                    Zed</p>
