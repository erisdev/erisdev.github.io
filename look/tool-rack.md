this tool rack is where i keep most of the tools of my various trades. aside from the usual suspects...

* [aseprite](https://aseprite.org/), a pixel art editing & animation tool that i use for all my crispy pixel needs
* the untamed beast known as [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
* everybody's (least) favorite 3d modeling tool, [blender](https://blender.org/)

tools are great, but why not [look at something else][workshop]?
