this tool rack is where i keep most of the tools of my various trades. aside from the usual suspects...

* [aseprite](https://aseprite.org/), a pixel art editing & animation tool that i use for _most_ of my art
* the venerable [textmate](https://macromates.com)
* nonlinear storytelling engine [twine](https://twinery.org/) (i used this
	one to build the space you're standing in)
* everybody's favorite 3d modeling tool, [blender](https://blender.org/)

tools are great, but why not [look at something else][workshop]?
